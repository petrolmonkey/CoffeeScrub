# Cafe_Data_Cleanup

## About
Coffee Scrub simulates the process of cleaning messy transaction data. It standardizes inconsistent columns, handles missing values, and prepares data for analysis such as customer segmentation or sales trends.

Key goals:
	•	Demonstrate best practices in data preprocessing.
	•	Provide reusable functions for cleaning similar datasets.
	•	Make data more reliable for visualization and modeling.
